# ProjectBox

**This is a work in progress.**

This is an OpenSCAD library to help with making project boxes for electronics projects.

Note: there are more well-developed libraries for this purpose, such as https://github.com/mrWheel/YAPP_Box. I developed this library organically for my own project before I looked for others.
